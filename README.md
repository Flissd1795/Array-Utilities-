# What are Data Structures?
- Data structures are ways of organising and storing data so it can be used efficiently
- Choosing the right data structure can make code simpler, faster, and more scalable

# What are Algorithms?
- A step-by-step process for solving a problem
- An algorithm works on data structures to produce a result
- Examples:
    - Sorting a list of numbers
    - Searching for a value
    - Finding the shortest path

# What is Big O Notation?
- Big O notation describes how an algorithm’s performance scales as the input size grows
- It measures growth rate, not exact time
- It focuses on:
    - Time complexity → how long it takes
    - Space complexity → how much memory it uses
- It helps to:
    - Predict performance at scale 
    - Avoid slow code as data grows
